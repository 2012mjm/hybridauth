# HybridAuth 3.0.0-dev branch

This branch contains work in progress toward the next HybridAuth 3 release and may be unstable.

Roadmap
-------
This roadmap outlines the planned strategy for HybridAuth 3.x, and it take into account a legit request by @EvanDotPro and many other ([#34](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/issues/34)) 

* Try to keep HybridAuth PHP 5.2 compatible if possible
* Make the migration process to HybridAuth 3.x easy and manageable
* Upgrade to PSR-[123]? ([cf. accepted ones](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/tree/master/accepted)
* Implement some coding standards (HybridAuth is a learning experience. Comments and constructive criticism are welcome and appreciated)
* Remove all the static usage in favor of real OOP practices
* Add official composer/packagist support for the core, default and extra providers
* Make it overall more friendly for integration with projects and frameworks (hopefully)
* Rewrite the code documentation and user guide (God help us all)
* ...
